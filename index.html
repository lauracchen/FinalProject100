        <h2>Land ownership</h2>
        <p>How are public vs. private landowners impacting carbon storage in forests? Model insights indicate that the area of forests that are successfully storing carbon could increase by about 2% if around 32,500 more acres of land were privately owned. This is roughly a land area the size of Cuyahoga Valley National Park to be transferred to private ownership. However, this switch has interesting implications: if land designation changes, there is less certainty over its end use, but in the southwestern US, privately owned land nonetheless tends to be more successful, on average, in sequestering carbon. It should also be considered that in this area, publicly owned forests greatly outnumbered privately owned forests, potentially skewing the analysis.

        <h2>Range vegetation improvement</h2>
        <p> While range vegetation improvement is aimed at improving land productivity for use by livestock, the data suggests that these improvements actually cause biomass to decrease over time. This is likely due to higher consumption levels by grazing livestock. According to the model, if all range improvement practices were halted, around 360 additional acres of forest area would begin acting as a carbon sink. Range vegetation improvement reduction might come as a result of a reduction in meat consumption, and thus lowered demand for livestock rearing.

        <h2>Hazardous fuel treatment</h2>
        <p>Because hazardous fuel reduction must thin trees and reduce vegetation to prevent wildfires, it naturally tends to result in lowered biomass. The model predicts that if hazardous fuel treatments were halted, 327 additional acres of forest land would function as a carbon sink. However, hazardous fuel treatments are still an important practice since the amount of carbon that could be released from wildfires is likely much higher than the amount released during hazardous fuel reduction. In addition, widespread wildfires can be highly hazardous and detrimental to human health.

        <p class="lead"><b>This project focuses on identifying and quantifying relationships between land ownership and management practices and aboveground biomass, which is a key indicator of carbon storage.</b> To mitigate global climate change, we are increasingly relying on forests as vast carbon sinks. As we look to our forests to provide havens for biodiversity and to store carbon to mitigate climate change, it is important to know how we are impacting forest growth and carbon storage. With pressures on land use and increasing wildfire risks, we will need to make the best use of limited forestland, but few studies comprehensively analyze whether forest ownership and management activities impact the ability of forests to store carbon.

        <p class="lead"><b>Using spatial data of public vs. private ownership and the US Forest Service’s main management categories, this project assesses variable relationships via conditional density plots, linear regression, and machine learning techniques.</b> My project analyzes public vs. private ownership and the US Forest Service’s main management categories to gather information from multiple data sources with different coordinate reference systems, resolutions, and extents. In order to establish relationships between ownership, management, and biomass, this project:
          <ul>
            <li>Categorized a 7 year aboveground biomass (AGB) change into increasing, decreasing, or stagnant in order to account for differences in growth rate of different forest types. Thus, this didn’t preference for fast, perhaps unhealthy invasive species growth

        <p class="lead">Due to the timeframe and scope of this project, there are a number of extensions that could provide deeper insights into the central question. These may also provide more explanation for the data variability. Despite the variables' statistical significance, the non-spatialized regression and RF models had low R^2 values.  Some extensions might include to:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Account for spatial autocorrelation. The data is likely to be autocorrelated, especially given that neighboring forests will certainly have an impact on each other. Met et. al. (2017) suggest that this may have a large impact on predictive power.
            </li>
            <li>
              Look at how data changes depending on what timeframe you consider management practices to have an impact; gather more theoretical or empirical data to support this decision.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a larger study area to get a wider range of cases and more data points, but account for changes in topography and climate. Due to timing and memory limitations, this project had to focus on a particular region in the southwestern US, which limits its applicability to other parts of the country or world. When running spatial analytics on such large datasets, I found that functions based in C++ tend to give much faster results, likely due to different memory management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Expand the study area or identify other datasets so that forest management activities may account for more variation. Because the spatial extent was cropped here, there were many fewer instances of forest management activities within the study region, over the study period. In addition to this, forest management activities were largely skewed towards public lands. Greater private reporting of management activities would lend to a greater understanding of how these practices impact carbon storage on private lands.
            </li>
            <li>
              Account for belowground carbon storage. Because of the diversity in the distribution of carbon above and belowground, a more comprehensive picture of the carbon stored by forests must include an understanding of how soil carbon changes with these variables as well.
